'''
Spirally traversing a matrix 

Given a matrix of size R*C. Traverse the matrix in spiral form.

Example 1:

Input:
R = 4, C = 4
matrix[][] = {{1, 2, 3, 4},
           {5, 6, 7, 8},
           {9, 10, 11, 12},
           {13, 14, 15,16}}
Output: 
1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10
Explanation:

Example 2:

Input:
R = 3, C = 4  
matrix[][] = {{1, 2, 3, 4},
           {5, 6, 7, 8},
           {9, 10, 11, 12}}
Output: 
1 2 3 4 8 12 11 10 9 5 6 7
Explanation:
Applying same technique as shown above, 
output for the 2nd testcase will be 
1 2 3 4 8 12 11 10 9 5 6 7.

Your Task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function spirally
Traverse() that takes matrix, R and C as input parameters and returns a list
of integers denoting the spiral traversal of matrix. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(R*C)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(R*C)
