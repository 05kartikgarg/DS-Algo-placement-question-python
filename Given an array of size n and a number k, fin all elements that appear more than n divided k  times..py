Given an array of size n and a number k, find all elements that appear more than n/k times
Given an array of size n, find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.
For example, if the input arrays is {3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3} and k is 4, then the output
should be [2, 3]. Note that size of array is 8 (or n = 8), so we need to find all elements
that appear more than 2 (or 8/4) times. There are two elements that appear more than two
times, 2 and 3.
